# ComfyUI_Fill-ChatterBox

A custom node extension for ComfyUI that adds text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) capabilities using the Chatterbox library.

## ‚ú® Enhanced Features

### üî• **NEW: Extended Text Support with Smart Chunking**
- **No more 40-second limitation!** Process texts of any length
- **üß† Intelligent sentence-aware chunking:** Automatically splits long texts at natural sentence boundaries (periods, exclamation marks, question marks)
- **üìè Adaptive chunk sizing:** 80-110 word chunks that end at sentence breaks for optimal quality and stability
- **üîÑ Seamless audio concatenation:** Chunks are processed individually and merged into one continuous audio output
- **üéØ Consistent voice cloning:** Same reference audio is used across all chunks for voice consistency
- **üìä Progress tracking:** Visual progress bar shows chunk processing status with detailed logging

## Features

### Text-to-Speech Node (FL Chatterbox TTS)
- **Extended text processing:** Handle texts longer than the original 40-second limit
- **üß† Smart chunking:** Text is intelligently split at sentence boundaries within safe word limits (80-110 words)
- **üéµ Natural audio flow:** Proper sentence endings ensure natural pauses and intonation
- **Voice cloning:** Use audio prompts for consistent voice replication across all chunks
- **Seamless output:** Individual audio chunks are concatenated into one continuous stream
- **GPU/CPU support:** Automatic fallback and device optimization
- **Persistent model loading:** Optional model caching for faster subsequent generations

### Voice Conversion Node (FL Chatterbox VC)
- Convert any voice to match a target voice sample
- CPU fallback if CUDA errors occur
- Efficient model management with optional persistence

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/filliptm/ComfyUI_Fill-ChatterBox.git
   ```

2. Install the base dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ComfyUI_Fill-ChatterBox/requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Text-to-Speech Node (FL Chatterbox TTS)
- Add the "FL Chatterbox TTS" node to your workflow
- **Input long texts:** No need to manually split - the node handles it automatically
- Configure parameters:
  - `exaggeration`: Controls emotion intensity (0.25-2.0)
  - `cfg_weight`: Controls pace/classifier-free guidance (0.2-1.0) 
  - `temperature`: Controls randomness in generation (0.05-5.0)
- Optionally provide an audio prompt for voice cloning
- **Monitor progress:** Watch the progress bar as each chunk is processed
- **Get seamless output:** Receive one continuous audio file regardless of input length

### Voice Conversion Node (FL Chatterbox VC)
- Add the "FL Chatterbox VC" node to your workflow
- Connect input audio and target voice
- Both nodes support CPU fallback if CUDA errors occur

## Technical Details

### Smart Sentence-Aware Chunking Algorithm
- **Intelligent boundaries:** Splits text at natural sentence endings (`.`, `!`, `?`) within safe word limits
- **Adaptive sizing:** Chunks range from 80-110 words, optimized for model stability and audio quality
- **Backwards search:** Algorithm searches backwards from the maximum limit to find the best sentence break
- **Fallback protection:** Uses hard word limits for extremely long sentences to prevent model failure
- **Quality optimization:** Natural sentence endings produce better intonation and speech flow

### Audio Concatenation
- Uses PyTorch tensor concatenation for efficiency
- Maintains consistent sample rate (16kHz) across chunks
- No audio artifacts at chunk boundaries
- Single continuous waveform output
- Enhanced validation prevents corrupted segments from affecting final output

### Performance Optimizations
- Model persistence across chunks (optional)
- GPU memory management with automatic cleanup
- Progress tracking for long text processing
- Efficient tensor operations for concatenation
- Comprehensive error handling with chunk-level recovery

## Change Log

### Latest (Fork Enhancement v2.0)
- **üöÄ MAJOR:** Intelligent sentence-aware chunking algorithm replaces simple word counting
- **üß† NEW:** Smart text splitting at natural sentence boundaries (periods, exclamation marks, question marks)

### Previous (Fork Enhancement v1.0)
- **üöÄ MAJOR:** Removed 40-second text limitation through intelligent chunking
- **‚ú® NEW:** Automatic text splitting into 90-word segments
- **‚ú® NEW:** Seamless audio concatenation of processed chunks
- **‚ú® NEW:** Enhanced progress tracking for chunk processing
- **üîß IMPROVED:** Better error handling for long text processing

## Limitations & Considerations

- **Processing time:** Longer texts will take proportionally longer to process
- **Memory usage:** Large texts may require more VRAM/RAM for model operations  
- **Prosody:** While voice consistency is maintained, natural speech flow across chunk boundaries may vary slightly
- **Optimal chunk size:** 130 words provides the best balance of stability and natural speech flow
